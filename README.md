#Translator and Text Summarizer
This code provides functionality for translating text from French to English using the Google Translate API and generating a summary of the translated text using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) based on term frequency.
Features:


#Translation to English:

Utilizes the Google Translate API to translate input text from French to English.
The translation functionality is achieved through the Translator class from the googletrans library.



#Text Preprocessing for LSA:

A preprocess_text function is provided to tokenize, remove punctuation and numbers, eliminate stop words, and lemmatize the text in preparation for LSA.



#Text Summarization using LSA:

The summarize function leverages Latent Semantic Analysis(LSA) to generate a summary of the input text.
The summary is created by assigning scores to sentences based on the frequency of important words and selecting the top N sentences.



#Important Note:


Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, including googletrans==4.0.0-rc1, nltk, and appropriate NLTK resources.


Use the Google Translate API responsibly, and be mindful of any usage limits or restrictions imposed by the service.


#Future Improvements:


Considering integrating additional language translation options or using alternative translation APIs.


Enhancing the summarization process by exploring more advanced natural language processing techniques.


Address any potential issues with dependencies, such as updates or changes to the Google Translate API.
